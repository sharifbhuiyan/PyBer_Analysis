## **<h1 align="center"> PyBer_Analysis**




  ## Overview of the PyBer_Analysis: 
<p align="justify">The analysis shows how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. A summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data has been created by city type. This dataframe shows the weekly fare by city type.  Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, a multiple-line graph has been created that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. <p>

<p align="justify">This analysis consists of two technical analysis.<p>

  - A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
  - A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type

 ## PyBer_Analysis Results: 
  
<p align="justify"> The following metrics are recreated to repeat the school district analysis : 


  - The district summary
  - The school summary
  - The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  - The average math score for each grade level from each school
  - The average reading score for each grade level from each school
  - The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type
 <p>

  i) The district summary has been changed after replacing the 9th grade students of Thomas High School. At present Overall passing rate is 64.9, whereas Previously was 65.2. It can be visualized by following snapshot. <p>

The command to select all the reading scores from the 9th grade at Thomas High School and replaced them with NaN: 
 

  # Use the graph style fivethirtyeight.

  ```ruby
    
    style.use('fivethirtyeight')

```
  

  The command to replace the overall passing percentage for Thomas High School in the per_school_summary_df: 
 
  # Save Figure
```ruby
    
  
  plt.savefig("analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png")

<p align="justify"> iv)	Since the ninth-grade scores of Thomas High school was replaced, in dataframe of each grade level Series for average math scores showing NaN. That means, 9th grade of Thomas school has no performance both on reading and math. It also impacted in spending range while creating spending_summary on Scores by school, size_summary on Scores by school size and type_summary on Scores by school type. </p>
