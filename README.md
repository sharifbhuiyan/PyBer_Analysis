## **<h1 align="center"> PyBer_Analysis**




  ## Overview of the PyBer_Analysis: 
<p align="justify">The analysis shows how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. A summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data has been created by city type. This dataframe shows the weekly fare by city type.  Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, a multiple-line graph has been created that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. <p>

<p align="justify">This analysis consists of two technical analysis.<p>

  - A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
  - A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type

 ## PyBer_Analysis Results: 
  
<p align="justify"> Analysis is demonstrated by describing details summary, ride-sharing data among the different city types and multiple-line chart.<p>

- <p align="justify">Ride-sharing data summary shows the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver, the summary is furnished with the 'city type' as index.<p>

</p>

  
  
  - <p align="justify">DataFrame has been created on date range: 2019-01-01 through 2019-04-28. It shows the weekly basis total fare according to different city type. Before that a pivot table has been created with the ‘date' as the index, the columns ='type', and values='fare'.<p>

  Command is used for Pivot table to get the total fares for each type of city by the date. 

```ruby
  pyber_fare_pivot_df = pd.pivot_table(pyber_fare_df,values='fare',index=['date'], columns=["type"])
```
  
  Command is used for create DataFrame using the "resample()" function by week 'W' and get the sum of the fares for each week.
  ```ruby
    
    pyber_fare_resample_df=pyber_fare_range_df.resample("w").sum()

```

- <p align="justify">A multiple-line chart has been created to visualise the the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.<p>

A graph style 'fivethirtyeight' is used for mmultiple-line chart.

```ruby
    
    style.use('fivethirtyeight')

```
  

   
To save the figure as png in analysis folder, code :
```ruby
      
  plt.savefig("analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png")

```
